'''
This file defines the encoder model(with attention). This can be used directly at test time to get the model embeddings in the higher dimensional space.

At train time, the ~loss.py~ file contains the decoder components(The GRL, Triplet loss, and the semantic loss), and they will be used to optimize the network.
